For photorealistic human faces, StyleGAN might be considered the best.
For high-resolution image synthesis, ProGAN and StyleGAN are both strong contenders.
For image-to-image translation with unpaired data, CycleGAN is a great choice.
For super-resolution tasks, SRGAN is specifically designed to excel.
For image-to-image translation with paired data, Pix2Pix is the preferred option.
